					<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
						The Amazon rainforest is a moist broadleaf forest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. 
						This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. 
						This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, 
						followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. 
						States or departments in four nations contain "Amazonas" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests
					</p>
					<br />
					<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
						The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes. 
						The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom. 
						Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by Herodotus and Diodorus

						<h2 class="text-left">History</h2>
						<hr />
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							<b>Natural:</b> The rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era. 
							It appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the Atlantic Ocean had 
							widened sufficiently to provide a warm, moist climate to the Amazon basin. The rainforest has been 
							in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes 
							at least until the current ice age, when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							<b>Sahara Desert dust windblown to the Amazon:</b> More than 56% of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest 
							comes from the Bodélé depression in Northern Chad in the Sahara desert. The dust contains phosphorus, 
							important for plant growth. The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed 
							away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods. Up to 50 million tonnes of Sahara dust per year are 
							blown across the Atlantic Ocean.

						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							Based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, human inhabitants first 
							settled in the Amazon region at least 11,200 years ago. Subsequent development led to late-prehistoric 
							settlements along the periphery of the forest by AD 1250, which induced alterations in the forest cover. 
							For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was 
							impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers 
							was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit 
							Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the 
							maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger 
							population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely 
							populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense 
							coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers

						<h2 class="text-left">Bio-diversity</h2>
						<hr />
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently 
							more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest 
							in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. One in ten known species in the 
							world lives in the Amazon rainforest. This constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal 
							species in the world.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. 
							To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have 
							been scientifically classified in the region. One in five of all bird species are found in the Amazon rainforest, and 
							one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 
							invertebrate species in Brazil alone.

						<h2 class="text-left">Climate Change</h2>
						<hr />
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also 
							about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming. Amazonian 
							evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores 
							in ecosystems—of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have 
							accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
							One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest 
							could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to 
							an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100. However, simulations of Amazon basin 
							climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging 
							from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though 
							the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.

				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Some of the most important trees in the world live in rainforests. Even though the nearest rainforest may be a long ways away from you, you still benefit from rainforests every day. 
					All rainforests have a canopy, which is a layer of branches and leaves formed at the tops of the tall trees that make up the rainforest. The canopy can easily be 100 feet or more above the ground.
				</p>
				<br />
				
				<h3 class="text-underline">What are the importance of rainforests to plants ?</h3>
				<br />
				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Tropical rainforests feature a wide variety of tall trees, diverse populations of plants and animals, warm climates and lots and lots of rain. To be a rainforest, an area must receive at least 80 inches of rain each year. Many rainforests receive an inch or more of rain every single day!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Unfortunately, every year a section of rainforest the size of the state of New Jersey is destroyed. Rainforest destruction occurs for many reasons, from cutting down trees for wood to making room for farms or roads. Many groups oppose rainforest destruction because of the important role rainforests play in our world.
				</p>
				<br />
				<ul class="text-justify">
					<li>Scientists sometimes call rainforests the “lungs" of Earth. The millions and millions of trees in Earth's rainforests absorb tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce much of the oxygen humans and animals depend upon for survival.</li>
					<li>Rainforests also help to stabilize Earth's climate. Scientists believe carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change. By absorbing carbon dioxide, rainforests help to reduce the effects of worldwide climate change.</li>
					<li>In addition to the important role rainforests play in Earth's climate, they also are an important home to about half of the species of plants and wildlife on the planet. Many of the species found in rainforests are endangered and can only survive in rainforests.</li>
					<li>Finally, rainforests help maintain the water cycle by producing large amounts of rainfall every year. Water produced in rainforests makes its way all over the world. As rainforests decrease in size, Earth's water cycle is affected, leading to droughts in different areas around the world.</li>
