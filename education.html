					Environmental awareness is an integral part of the movement’s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical environment is fragile and indispensable we can begin fixing the problems that threaten it.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Before you can begin promoting environmental awareness in your own community you must first make sure that you have a thorough understanding of environmental issues. Staying up to date on environmental news and reading comprehensive books about environmental threats are both great resources, but if you’re the type of person who prefers a more interactive approach, attending environmental seminars is a great option.

				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Advocacy is working to influence public policy in social, economic, political, and cultural spheres in order to bring about justice and positive change in human rights and environmental issues. Environmental Advocacy involves both protecting the public from environmental hazards and protecting the natural world. Advocates organize a group around a cause and work to implement changes that have a lasting and positive effect. For example, a community group with an advocate (leader) may lobby state legislature and educate the public to help pass a public-health bill that they feel is important.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="fieldset-paragraph text-justify">
					Environmental organizations today are striving to have the same professional skills as private and government organizations in order to be more effective Environmental Advocates. Well-qualified leaders are very important to these organizations, even on the grass-roots level. Sometimes, a distinction is made between advocates (those who speak for the public on an issue) and organizers (community leaders who empower the people to solve problems themselves), although often organizers are also advocates. Environmental Advocacy is a very rewarding field for those with strong commitments to social justice and environmental policy reform.
